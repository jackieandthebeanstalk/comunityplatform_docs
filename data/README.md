# Data

Explore our comprehensive guide to building application data. Gain essential knowledge and practical insights on data modelling and effective data access strategies to build scalable applications.Developers using the ComUnity Developer Toolkit have the flexibility to build their application data models either as a Diagram (Entity Relationship Diagram - ERD) or as a List, each offering unique benefits.When visualising the data model as a Diagram (ERD), developers gain a clear and intuitive representation of the data entities and their relationships. This visual approach simplifies the process of specifying entity properties, defining relationships, and establishing data constraints. Diagrams (ERDs) aid in designing an effective database schema, allowing developers to easily identify and optimise the structure and connections between entities.On the other hand, representing the data model as a List provides a concise and organised view of the entities and their properties. This approach offers a straightforward way to define the structure of the data without the need for a visual diagram. Developers can easily specify entity properties, data types, and relationships using the List format, making it a suitable option for simpler data models or cases where a visual representation may not be necessary.Both approaches have their advantages. The Diagram (ERD) provides a visual representation that aids in understanding and optimising complex data relationships, while the List format offers a streamlined view for simpler data structures or when a visual diagram is not required.Regardless of the chosen representation, the ComUnity Developer Toolkit seamlessly translates the configuration from either a Diagram or a List into a Visual Studio project using the [Entity Framework Code First ](https://app.gitbook.com/o/v0hmafhved1NwFsQQmjL/s/ts7usaOWKl6I75i4yVg9/reference-articles/glossary#entity-framework-code-first)approach. This ensures a smooth transition from either an ERD or a List to the creation of the corresponding database structure, providing developers with a convenient and efficient data modelling experience.When you create a new project in the Toolkit using one of our starter templates, the Toolkit will create a basic, predefined, and fully customisable data model for your project.
